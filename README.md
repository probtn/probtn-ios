How to use ProBtn SDK
-----

1. First you have to register on [http://admin.probtn.com](http://admin.probtn.com)
2. Register your app: create new application, select it's platform (iOS) and fill in your app's BundleId;
3. Choose the sites to promote in your application.
4. Set up the targeting.
5. Finally you have to embed ProBtn into your app.

Integrating ProBtn SDK into your ObjC iOS App
-----

1. First you are to clone repository or just download the archive to you computer.
2. Add file libProBtn-1.x.a to your project (Target -> Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries).
3. Add header files ProBtn.h and ProBtnVersion.h to you project.
4. Add  QuartzCore.framework, UIKit.framework, CoreGraphics.framework, CoreLocation.framework, MediaPlayer.framework to your project Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries
5. Import the file ProBtn.h with the derictive #import "ProBtn.h"
6. After your app was initialised you have to call method [ProBtn open] 
7. By default all the screen orientations are supported. You can restrict anyone of them in any time by calling method  [ProBtn setAvailableOrientations:]
8. Feel free to control the button at any time by calling methods:  [ProBtn close], [ProBtn show], [ProBtn hide], [ProBtn setButtonWindowLevel:]

Example:

	@implementation AppDelegate
	
	// Code
	
	- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
	    // Code
		
	    // Show button
	    [ProBtn open];

	    // Set supported orientations (by default - all orientations)
	    if(UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPhone) {
	        [ProBtn setAvailableOrientations:ProBtnInterfaceOrientationMaskkAllButUpsideDown];
	    } else {
	        [ProBtn setAvailableOrientations:ProBtnInterfaceOrientationMaskAll];
	    }
	    return YES;
	}
	
	// Code
	
Server side
---------------

ProBtn can respond to actions from webview. Three type of actions available at this moment:

1. proBtn.hide(); Hide button and content view.
2. proBtn.hideContent(); Close content view.
3. proBtn.performAction(); Send event to the server that the user has performed required action for the current campaign. If targeting is properly configured on the server side, next time button is loaded by the user - new campaign will be displayed. If the user has performed required actions for all campaigns available to him, button will not be shown.

All of these actions can be performed from javascript code in your site. For example, you can set action as a listener on button event (see example page at http://nameless-fortress-6801.herokuapp.com/).

All the settings are taken from the server so you can customize the appiarence of the button by simply changing the on the serverside. 
The server adress is [admin.probtn.com](http://admin.probtn.com). After all the data loaded from the server the button would appear automatically.
